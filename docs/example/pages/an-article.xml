There's not much on here yet. I will use this as an example of how the
Reference plugin works though. If you want references, we got references.
Maybe an article from <a ref:site="wp">wikipedia</a>,
or a video from <a ref:site="wp" ref:term="Youtube">that famous video site</a>.
Whatever floats your boat.

There are more paragraphs, but they aren't very interesting either.
