WhiteNoise: A Static Site Builder
------------------------------------

= Introduction =

WhiteNoise is a Perl 6 application for building and maintaining static websites.
It is loosely based on my Webtoo Websight series of web frameworks, and borrows
many things from the Perl 6 version known as ww6.

Unlike ww6, it is not a "general purpose framework". Where ww6 can be used
to build any kind of web application, WhiteNoise does only one thing:
It builds static websites.

The key word here is static. While ww6 is meant for building dynamic sites
powered by SCGI, and using great things like AJAX, this is meant for building
simple blog-like sites, such as say huri.net.

= Key Features =

 * Based on the same core technologies as ww6:
   - JSON for metadata/configuration files.
   - XML for templates/articles.
 * Generates static websites only, this is NOT ww6.
 * Does not handle URLs, (S)CGI, etc. This is NOT ww6.
 * There are two kinds of plugins supported.
   - Page plugins are specific to WhiteNoise pages.
     One comes with WhiteNoise, see below.
   - Flower plugins, are used on the templates.
     A set of these come with Flower itself.
 * Site templates are TAL templates, parsed using Flower.
   They are referenced to from the site config.
 * Templates will be even simpler once Flower supports METAL macros.
 * Indexes are tag-based.
 * Articles are XML snippets, with JSON meta-data.
 * Stories are collections of articles, that show up as a single
   entry in the indexes. Articles that belong to stories do not have
   individual tags.
 * A paragraph, div or span marked with 'id'=>'snippet' will be used
   as the short description of the page for indexes.
 * If you don't specify a 'snippet', the first node found will be
   used as the snippet instead.
 * An example Page Plugin is included: References.
   This plugin looks for <a ref:site="name">term</a>
   or <a ref:site="name" ref:term="term">description</a>
   links, and looks up the reference URL in the site config.
   The reference URL must have a '%s' which will be replaced by the
   term. The example config has Wikipedia as a reference site with the
   site key 'wp', so you could lookup <a ref:site="wp">Perl 6</a> with
   a simple tag like that.

= Usage =

After setting up a site configuration (see docs/example/),
you can generate your site by doing:

 $ whitenoise --conf ./mysite.json ./pages/2011/first.xml

Where the xml file is the page to generate. You can specify
multiple pages on the command line. You can also make a list of
pages in a text file, and use:

 $ whitenoise --conf ./mysite.json --list ./pages.txt

Or if you don't care about the order the pages are added to
the indexes, you can just tell it to process an entire directory:

 $ whitenoise --conf ./mysite.json --dir ./pages

Presto, that's it. Your pages are generated and added to any
applicable indexes and/or stories.

= Summary =

It's an interesting way to build a site.

This was created specifically for huri.net, but can be used
for other sites if you really feel like it.
